/*********************************************************************
*
*  Initial module!
*
*  This module is not responsible for styles,
*  It serves only to import other modules,
*  starting the project.
*
*  If your site is SPA (Single Page Application),
*  use only the main.scss or main.sass
*
*  If a project with multiple pages, create more .css or .sass
*  for each page. Examples include the about.html page so let's
*  create about.scss or about.sass Within these modules you import
*  the required modules for the page. Do not set styles on them.
*
*  So you do not overload the css with extra weight
*
*  The sass files are compiled at runtime and automatically
*  created in the folder css/
*
*  The vendors folder there are some libraries that usually use,
*  be my guest if you want or it does not matter.
*
* The css modularization is up to you, if you like smacss, bem,
* oocss, drycss feel free to change and use as it sees best.
* For some time I adopted my modularization involving some smacss.
